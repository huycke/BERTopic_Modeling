# Embedding Model & Dependencies
sentence-transformers
# torch # CPU version typically installed by default with sentence-transformers if not present.
# For PyTorch with GPU (CUDA) support, DO NOT rely on this line.
# Install manually following instructions at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Example (CHECK WEBSITE for YOUR CUDA version): pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# (Alternative PyTorch CUDA example from user file)
# pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128


# Default CPU-based Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering for BERTopic
umap-learn # CPU UMAP
hdbscan # CPU HDBSCAN


# --- GPU Acceleration (Optional - Requires Manual Installation & RAPIDS) ---
# The following lines are for NVIDIA RAPIDS GPU acceleration.
# These are typically installed via conda and have specific hardware/driver requirements.
# See: https://rapids.ai/start.html
#
# Example for RAPIDS cuDF, cuML, etc. (from user file, ensure compatibility with your environment):
# pip install \
#     --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com \
#     "cudf-cu12==25.4.*" "dask-cudf-cu12==25.4.*" "cuml-cu12==25.4.*" \
#     "cugraph-cu12==25.4.*" "nx-cugraph-cu12==25.4.*" "cuspatial-cu12==25.4.*" \
#     "cuproj-cu12==25.4.*" "cuxfilter-cu12==25.4.*" "cucim-cu12==25.4.*" \
#     "pylibraft-cu12==25.4.*" "raft-dask-cu12==25.4.*" "cuvs-cu12==25.4.*"
