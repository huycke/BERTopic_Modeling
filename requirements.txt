# Embedding Model & Dependencies
sentence-transformers
# torch # CPU version installed by default with sentence-transformers if not present.
# For PyTorch with GPU (CUDA) support, DO NOT rely on this line.
# Install manually following instructions at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Example (CHECK WEBSITE for YOUR CUDA version): pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# FOR RAPIDS
# 

# pip install \

umap-learn # CPU UMAP
hdbscan # CPU HDBSCAN

# --- GPU Acceleration (Optional - Requires Manual Installation) ---
# For GPU-accelerated UMAP and HDBSCAN using NVIDIA RAPIDS cuML:
# 1. Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and drivers.
# 2. Install RAPIDS cuML, preferably using conda. Follow instructions: https://rapids.ai/start.html#get-rapids
# 3. You typically install 'cuml' via conda, not pip, e.g.: conda install -c rapidsai cuml -c conda-forge -c nvidia
# cuml # Commented out as installation is manual and preferably via conda

# --- Visualization ---
plotly
matplotlib
seaborn
adjustText # Used in BERTopic_Visualizations.ipynb

# --- Utilities & I/O ---
tqdm # For progress bars
openpyxl # For reading/writing Excel files (used in Preprocessing_May.ipynb)

# --- Jupyter Environment (Optional but good for reproducibility if sharing notebooks) ---
# jupyterlab
# notebook
